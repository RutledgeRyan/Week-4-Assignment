# Week-4-Assignment

In this assignment Hayden created the outline of the page with the content colors and characteristics of the cards. From there Glody was able to add all information into the cards and adjust cards. I was responsible for filling out any remaining cards, organizing the size and layout of pictures within the cards. We utilized our extensive knowledge of cards for this project and felt very comfortable.
